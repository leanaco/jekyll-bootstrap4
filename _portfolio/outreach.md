I worked as a college ambassador for the College of Engineering and Computer Science, ANU, for over 2 years. I was heavily involved in outreach events, especially those targetting at getting more young women into STEM programs.

I frequently was involved in ANU Open Day activities where I spoken to prospective students and their parents. I showcased the work that we did in the research group and encouraged them to think about a future in ICT.

I was involved in promoting computer science for the college and ANU. For example, the following promotional videos by ANU:

- [Be a tech girl and make a difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjNItnI1dBE)
- [Computing at ANU - There's more to it than you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_w5vV76flw)

Events I frequently participated in include: 

- [Girls in ICT Day](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/events/girls-ict-day)
- [Girls in Engineering and Technology Program (GET Set)](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/events/get-set)
- [ANU Open Day](http://www.anu.edu.au/study/choose-anu/open-day-2016)
 
<!-- I coordinated the development of a workshop to be used as an ongoing outreach program for the college. -->

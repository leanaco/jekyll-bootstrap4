I am fascinated by where people look and how they read.

A large part of my PhD thesis and honours work was on the use of eye tracking to analyse and predict reading behaviour. I conducted several eye tracking studies to investigate reading behaviour in eLearning environments. This section introduces one of the eye tracking studies I conducted. 

## Reading in a (visually) distracting environment

I conducted a preliminiary user study to investigate how participants read in distracting environments and potential mechanisms to mitigate distractions. In this study I used __eye tracking__ record participants eye gaze and used in **real-time** to create the mitigation signals.

Digital environments are dynamic, competitively distracting the user with alerts, advertising, social media, and other distractions. It has been shown that distractions can impair reading comprehension and that visual distractions lead to disruptions in cognition.

**Hypothesis: Attention guidance will reduce the disruption of visual distractions during reading.**

A between-subjects design with 3 independent factors: 1) the text difficulty; 2) the distraction mitigation signal; and 3) whether English was their first reading language. Data was collected from 66 (28 female) participants.

### What I found from this preliminiary study
<ul>
	<li>Text readability didn't affect distraction rate, but there was a much lower distraction rate than expected.</li>
	<li>Participants noted that the knew they were being distracting and consciously avoided looking, perhaps leading to a lower than expected distraction rate.</li>
	<li>Highlighting and making the last word bold (signal A) was perceieved to help participants recover from distractions.</li>
</ul>

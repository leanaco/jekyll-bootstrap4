I was part of a team that won the [OzCHI 2015](https://www.ozchi24.org/) Student Design Challenge. The Australian Human-Computer Interaction (OzCHI) conference is an annual conference held in Australia aimed at sharing knowledge on all things HCI.

The student design challenge is held as part of the conference. It is a 24-hour challenge in which students get to design a solution to fit a brief given at the beginning of the 24-hour period. This is an intense, but fun and rewarding experience.

### My role

I led the research process including, contexual inquiries. 
I assisted in the prototyping, co-wrote the final research paper, and presented at the OzCHI Student Design Challenge 2015 where our team won first place.


## The problem

The challenge involved identifying a target group that experiences social isolation (e.g. the elderly, carers, children or teenagers with an illness, homeless people) and to think of how this group could help by connecting with other people in meaningful ways.

## The process

The Double Diamond design methodology was the approach taken for conceptualizing a design solution. This methodology was chosen since an understanding of the needs and experiences of our target group (the unemployed) guided our design decisions, and the diverge-converge process allowed us to creatively explore the problem from different angles.

### Literature review and identifying the target group

We begun by reading existing research on the area to get a better understanding of the problem and figure out what our target group would be. Each team member did individual research on the problem, after which we came back together for a group discussion on what we found in the literature.

</div>

</div>

We established from the literature that there were multiple reasons why people might be social isolated. We decided that it would be best if we had some connection to the problem as we did not have an extensive amount of time to conduct user research.

We decided that target demographic would be unemployed individuals who suffer from social isolation as a consequence of unemployment. 

### Contextural inquiries

Contextural inquiries with five people recruited from our personal networks were conducted to identify key problem areas, with questions centred on their use of resources during job seeking periods. Interview data informed the development of personas reflecting common themes and issues.

<div class="col three caption">
	The 5 problems that occur as a result of unemployment
</div>

From the user research we identifed that there are 5 problems that occur as a result of unemployment including loss of: time structure, social contacts, collective purpose, status, and activity. Loss of these elements can lead to social isolation. Market research indicated that no existing solution dealt with all five problems.


### Personas

We developed 3 personas from the data collected from the contextual inquiries to help guide the design process.

### Ideating

We used the BadIdeas 3.0 workshop as an ideation exercise to generate innovative design solutions. Four initial paper prototypes of potential solutions were produced, and a SWOT analysis was used to identify the most effective design concept.

<div class="col three caption"> 
    VIRK: Virtual work environment to facilitate interaction between the unemployed
</div>

The chosen design concept is Virtual Work (VIRK), an interactive virtual environment system promoting and facilitating social interaction amongst unemployed people. 

### Prototyping

We developed both paper and digital prototypes, and created a film to demonstrate their use.
The idea is that virtual environments could be used to support social connection and journey to employment. This is via facilitate of interaction, creating time structure and giving purpose. 

Our idea hinged on the Google Cardboard, whereby a smartphone could be turned into a VR headset.

</div>

Using these we created a paper prototype to mock up the potential functionality, and later developed wireframe of the interface using Protoshare. 

### Presenting to OzCHI

We were selected as finalists to present at the OzCHI 2015 conference. 

All team members presented and took part in the Q&A section of the presentation.

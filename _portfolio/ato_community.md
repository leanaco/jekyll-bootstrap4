## The problem

ATO gets a lot of calls to their call centre so they wanted to promote a self-help / community forum help capability to try to alleviate pressure on the call centre. The forum needed to be design and developed to be user-centred. This required a long term user testing plan to encompass all stages of the design and development life cycle.

## The solution

I led the creation of the research plan covering multiple phases In the design process. I led the analysis of the data across all stages.

## The team

[ATO Beta](https://beta.ato.gov.au/)

## My role

I led the research on the [ATO Community forum](https://community.ato.gov.au/) project, including research during discovery through to private and public beta phases.

## Tools

- [Loop11](https://www.loop11.com/)
- [UserZoom](https://www.userzoom.com/)
- Python for data anlysis, in particular [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)


## The process

### Contextual Inquiries and concept testing

At the point that our team was brought in, the idea of a community forum had already been decided as the solution.

We conducted to contextual inquiries with several user groups including tax professionals and small business owners to identify user needs for a forum.

We asked participants about how they currently got help with tax related questions and problems. We then asked them about their usage of community forums and what they liked or didnâ€™t like about those forums.  
 
At this stage we also did early testing of the concept of the community forum by showing them a mock-up and asking them their impression of it, what improvements could be made, as well as where they would go to complete some basic tasks.

From this point the design and development of a private beta version of the forum happened. We concurrently planned out a test scheme to work in with design and development.

### Moderated usability testing of private beta

We conducted two rounds of moderated usability testing. Both rounds were hour long sessions based on a script of tasks and questions we were interested in investigating.

In the first round we conducting one-on-one usability testing with 6 participants in a usability lab. The moderated session covered some of the key interactions with the forum, such as registration, finding different types of content, and posting a question. I was the co-led facilitation of these sessions.

We using affinity diagramming to analyse the observations and find the trends in user behaviour. We then prioritised the issues that we found with stakeholders and development team. The forum was rapidly iterated to resolve the high priority issues. 

Some of these key issues included the registration process, information architecture, content from forum moderators, and content tags such as "Solved" and "Certified" not being identified.

After this we tested the changes with a second group of 6 participants, once again in a one-on-one setting. We had a mix of participants coming into our office and us going out to them. We used the same testing script.

Once again, affinity diagramming was used to analyse the observations. We were able to validate that our changes had resolved the high priority issues identified in the first round as well as identify some additional problem. Reprioritisation of usability and design issues occurred with stakeholders and development team.

### Unmoderated remote usability testing of public beta

After the forum was iterated based on the second round of moderated testing it was release to public beta. This allowed us to gather a much larger amount of quantitative data aspect of the forum. We designed a remote unmoderated usability test to particular parts of the forum and further exploring the issues of the "Solved" and "Certified" answers.

We were still unclear at this point whether users noticed tags used to identify these content types as well as whether they understood what both meant. Another issue to do with these content types involves the level of trust users place on the two types of content. For example, we would hope the users trust an answer marked as "Certified" more than an answer only marked as "Solved".

We also further tested search behaviour, and user perceived satisfaction.

The test was built in [Loop11](https://www.loop11.com/).

The results of this test were analysed using Python, see my [portfolio article on the data analysis framework]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/data_analysis.md %}).

The results from this test were inconclusive in telling us whether users actually trusted "Certified"  answer more than "Solved". This was put down to the fact that users purhaps hadn't learnt yet what the tags represented. This meant that further testing on long-term users of the forum would need to be carried out.

These results were used to further iterate the forum. 

### Online surveys of public beta

There are on-going surveys of ATO Community to continually assess satisfaction and assess whether users are learning about the "Solved" and "Certified" content types. As mentioned, there was a question of whether long-term user would learn the difference between the tags and learn to trust "Certified" tags more. 

This survey was built in [UserZoom](https://www.userzoom.com/) and was still running at the time that I left ATO.

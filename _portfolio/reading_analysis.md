I am fascinated by where people look and how they read.

A large part of my PhD thesis and honours work was on the use of eye tracking to analyse and predict reading behaviour. I conducted several eye tracking studies to investigate reading behaviour in eLearning environments. This section introduces one of the eye tracking studies I conducted. 
            
## Reading in eLearning environments

I used eye tracking to investigate how different sequences of text and comprehension questions affected eye movements, and reading behaviour for first (L1) English language and second (L2) English language readers.

A between-subjects design was used with 2 independent factors: 1) presentation sequence, and 2) whether English was their first reading language. There were 4 different presentation sequences. Eye gaze was collected from 60 participants.

The 4 presentation sequences are denoted formats A through D. Formats A presents to the text to participants at two stages, first, only the text is shown and participants are asked to read it, denoted A(1). Secondly, it is presented below the questions, denoted A(2).

The first case is similar to formats C and D, where in format C and text is shown to participants and then the questions are shown another page. In format D, the questions are shown on a page for the participants to read, then the text is shown on a second page, and finally, on the third page the questions are shown again without the text.

The differences in eye movements and reading patterns are shown below, when reading the text in isolation from the questions, such as in formats A, C, and D. The main difference is that when participants where presented the text in format D they tended to skim and read only the parts of the text relating to the questions.

As mentioned format A displayed text to participants twice, first as above, and secondly with comprehension questions, as below, similarly to format B.</p>

### Conclusion

Different presentation sequences induce different levels of reading comprehension, as well as different eye movement and reading patterns. The sequence can affect how a participant reads the text as well as their perceptions of how well they understood what they read. For instance, if questions and text are not shown together, this improves participantsâ€™ ability to accurately perceive their comprehension and promotes thorough reading. Alternatively, showing questions before the text promotes skimming behaviour.

Importantly, the presentation sequence affects both L1 and L2 readers in the same way. We observe L2 reader take longer to read text but have the same comprehension levels as L1 readers, this difference comes primarily from longer fixation durations.

The results from this study can be used to design learning materials in eLearning environments to influence how students interact with the learning environment as well as how they learn. The purpose of this investigation is to make informative decisions about designing adaptive eLearning environments.


## Answer-seeking behaviour

As shown above formats A(2) and B the large jumps between questions and text. These jumps are followed by read. We define this as answer-seeking behaviour. There was a distribution of answer-seeking beahiour observed for different questions in the study. We propose the use of this measure as an indicator of question difficulty.

The goal is to provide feedback to instructors about implicit behaviour of students performing a reading task through an online learning environment. For example, if the instructor receives feedback that multiple students are failing to understand specific parts of the text then the instructor can dedicate more time explaining these concepts during face-to-face teaching time.

We found no significant difference between the L1 and L2 readers in answer-seeking behaviour.

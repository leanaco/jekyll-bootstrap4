I am fascinated by where people look and how they read.

A large part of my PhD thesis and honours work was on the use of eye tracking to analyse and predict reading behaviour. I conducted several eye tracking studies to investigate reading behaviour in eLearning environments. This section introduces one of the eye tracking studies I conducted. 


## Text difficulty and reading behaviour

I conducted a user study to collect eye rtacking data from participants as they read texts with differing degrees of difficulty. The grades of text difficulty were based on different levels of readability and conceptual difficulty. I further investigated the  eye movements and reading behaviours of L1 and L2 readers. 

The eye gaze of 70 participants (23 female) was collected, 46 of which were first English language readers (L1). There were 9 grades of text difficulty, denoted A to J, as shown in the matrix below. Texts were on average 240 words (standard deviation of 20 words).

Participants were asked to 9 text with differing text difficulty in different orders. They were asked two comprehension questions after each text as well as a survey on the their perception of readability and conceputal difficulty.

We found that readability affects fixations but not regressions and that there is a significant difference between the L1 and L2 readers number of fixations and tendency to regress. There was no interaction effect between the reader groups and the text difficulty, indicating Tthat in this study the readability and conceptual difficulty of the text affect the two groups similarly.

Analysis of participants’ perceptions showed that they are poor at predicting predefined text difficulty, especially when the readability and the conceptual difficulty are not the same. The readability and conceptual difficulty of a text interact with each other to distort participants’ perceptions of overall text difficulty.

The key highlights of the participants’ perceptions:

<ul>
    <li>L1 and L2 readers have different perceptions:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>L2 readers tend to overestimate difficulty of the text</li>
            <li>L1 readers tend to underestimate the difficulty of the text</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Both groups overestimate complexity as E where the readability and conceptual difficulty are both in the middle of the scale.</li>
    <li>Both groups tend to conflate the levels of readability and conceptual difficulty, thus under estimating all texts surrounding the main diagonal, especially as complexity ratings C and G.</li>
    <li>Their eye movements are a reflection of both the predefined and explicitly perceived text difficulty.</li>
</ul>

The two extremes in the readability and conceptual level do not mix well when they are inverses of one another, (texts C and G). The interaction between the two variables results in an underestimation of one variable and overestimation of the other.

Cluster analysis of eye movement reveals that whilst there are clusters of different reading behaviours for different levels of text difficulty, such as skimming and thorough reading, the L1 and L2 groups were not found to be distinct from each other.

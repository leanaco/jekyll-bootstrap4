## The problem

[ATO Beta](https://beta.ato.gov.au/) experienced a decline in engagement from their subscriber list. The subscriber list is a key source of test participants for the remote unmoderated tests and surveys that are released so it is important to keep them engaged.

## The solution

User research on the [ATO Beta](https://beta.ato.gov.au/) subscriber list was needed to investigate interest in the service and what could be done to boost engagement of the current subscribers.

* [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)

## The process

We developed a survey to gather quantitative data with some qualitative data, to get as many responses as possible from the subscriber list. The survey looked at finding out the demographics of subscribers, thier preferred method of communication, what they wanted from the ATO Beta service, how reguarly they wanted to hear from ATO Beta, and when they want to be contacted.

## Data analysis

The key to this project was the data analysis. We were interested in what our subscribers wanted but also of there were differences in what they wanted and whether we needed to consider sending customised content to them. 

Using statical analysis we could see that there was no significant difference between groups of users. This meant that we had grounds to continue delivering content the way that we had been. 

The other aspect of the data analysis was comparing the survey results with Google Analytics data from the ATO Beta website. This allowed us to compare the subscribers who took part in the survey to those who visited to see if there were any key difference between those groups.

Finally, presentation of these results was important to show stakeholders. We needed to have evidence for producing different sorts of content and knowing when was bet to release content and tests. 

One example of this is that from the survey we realised our subscribers wanted to hear about the results of tests they had taken part in so this promoted the use of the blog. 

Another example was not knowing when was best to publish content and tests. We foudn specific patterns in the survey and Google analytics data that indicated several key periods that was best to send out communications being early in the week between morning to mid-afternoon. This is important for us to know given that from testing we knew that participants really only did the tests within 48 hours of the test being released. So maximising the 48 hour window is really important. 

### Take away message

This project demostrated that more than one method of user research can often get you a better picture of your users.
